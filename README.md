# Sentinel-2 snow cover product use case: snow line elevation
This Python notebook shows how to explore the snow line elevation variability across the Pyrenees range 
from a Sentinel-2 snow cover map ([HRSI](https://land.copernicus.eu/pan-european/biophysical-parameters/high-resolution-snow-and-ice-monitoring) or 
[Theia](https://theia.cnes.fr) ).

On 25 and 26 Sep 2020 occurred an early snowfall in the Pyrenees. 
The snow cover area [was captured by Sentinel-2](https://labo.obs-mip.fr/multitemp/september-snow-captured-by-sentinel-2/) the day after on Sep 27. 
Here we use the Sentinel-2 data to characterize the spatial differences in the snowline elevation. 
Since the image was captured right after the snowfall, these differences should reflect those of the zero degree isotherm elevation during the snowfall.
